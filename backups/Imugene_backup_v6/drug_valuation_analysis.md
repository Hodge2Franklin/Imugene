# Imugene (IMU.AX) Drug Valuation Models

## Overview

This analysis provides valuation models for each of Imugene's drug candidates based on risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV) methodology. The models incorporate probability of success, potential peak sales, royalty rates, and time to market to estimate the current value of each program.

## Methodology

The valuation models use the following approach:

1. **Probability of Success**: Based on historical success rates for oncology drugs at similar development stages
2. **Peak Annual Sales**: Estimated based on market size, competition, and clinical differentiation
3. **Royalty Rate**: Typical rates for licensing deals at the current development stage
4. **Time to Market**: Projected years until potential commercial launch
5. **Discount Rate**: 12% used as standard for biotech risk profile
6. **Sales Curve**: Ramp-up over 3 years, plateau for 4 years, then gradual decline

## Key Assumptions

- **Licensing Model**: All valuations assume Imugene licenses the drugs to larger pharmaceutical companies rather than commercializing directly
- **Patent Life**: 10 years of effective commercial exclusivity post-launch
- **No Manufacturing**: Consistent with Imugene's strategy of not wanting to manufacture
- **Financing Risk**: These valuations do not account for the financing risk given Imugene's limited cash runway

## Valuation Summary

| Drug | Current Phase | Probability of Success | Peak Annual Sales (M AUD) | Royalty Rate | Time to Market (Years) | Risk-Adjusted NPV (M AUD) |
|------|---------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Azer-cel (DLBCL) | Phase 1b | 0.15 | 1200.0 | 0.12 | 3.5 | 63.5 |
| HER-Vaxx (Gastric Cancer) | Completed Phase 2 | 0.25 | 500.0 | 0.08 | 2.5 | 32.9 |
| NeoPOLEM (MSI-high CRC) | Phase 2 | 0.15 | 400.0 | 0.10 | 3.0 | 18.7 |
| CF33/VAXINIA (Bile Tract) | Phase 1 | 0.08 | 300.0 | 0.15 | 3.0 | 11.2 |
| CF33/VAXINIA (Solid Tumors) | Phase 1 | 0.05 | 800.0 | 0.10 | 4.0 | 11.1 |
| PD1-Vaxx (NSCLC) | Phase 1 | 0.05 | 700.0 | 0.08 | 4.0 | 7.8 |

## Total Portfolio Value

The total risk-adjusted NPV of Imugene's drug portfolio is estimated at **AUD 145.2 million**.

## Current Market Capitalization

Imugene's current market capitalization is approximately AUD 200 million.

## Valuation Gap Analysis

Based on this analysis, Imugene appears to be overvalued by approximately AUD 54.8 million.

## Key Risks and Considerations

1. **Cash Runway**: With only 4.4 months of cash remaining, Imugene will need to raise additional capital, likely resulting in significant dilution
2. **Clinical Risk**: All programs face substantial clinical development risk, particularly the early-stage assets
3. **Competitive Landscape**: Several programs face intense competition, particularly in the CAR-T and immuno-oncology spaces
4. **Licensing Dependency**: The valuation assumes successful licensing deals, which are not guaranteed
5. **Regulatory Hurdles**: While some programs have received FDA designations, regulatory approval remains uncertain

## Individual Drug Analyses

### Azer-cel (DLBCL)

- **Current Phase**: Phase 1b
- **Probability of Success**: 0.15
- **Peak Annual Sales**: AUD 1200 million
- **Royalty Rate**: 0.12
- **Time to Market**: 3.5 years
- **Risk-Adjusted NPV**: AUD 63.5 million
- **Unadjusted NPV**: AUD 423.3 million

Azer-cel represents Imugene's most advanced and valuable asset, with promising Phase 1b data showing a 44% response rate. The FDA Fast Track designation enhances its regulatory prospects. However, it faces competition from approved CAR-T therapies and other allogeneic approaches.

### CF33/VAXINIA (Solid Tumors)

- **Current Phase**: Phase 1
- **Probability of Success**: 0.05
- **Peak Annual Sales**: AUD 800 million
- **Royalty Rate**: 0.10
- **Time to Market**: 4.0 years
- **Risk-Adjusted NPV**: AUD 11.1 million
- **Unadjusted NPV**: AUD 222.2 million

The broad solid tumor indication for VAXINIA offers substantial market potential, but faces significant clinical risk given the historically challenging nature of oncolytic virus development. The complete response in one patient provides early validation but requires confirmation in larger cohorts.

### CF33/VAXINIA (Bile Tract)

- **Current Phase**: Phase 1
- **Probability of Success**: 0.08
- **Peak Annual Sales**: AUD 300 million
- **Royalty Rate**: 0.15
- **Time to Market**: 3.0 years
- **Risk-Adjusted NPV**: AUD 11.2 million
- **Unadjusted NPV**: AUD 140.0 million

The Orphan Drug Designation for bile tract cancer provides regulatory advantages and potentially higher royalty rates. The maintained complete response for over two years in one patient is encouraging, though the small sample size limits confidence.

### HER-Vaxx (Gastric Cancer)

- **Current Phase**: Completed Phase 2
- **Probability of Success**: 0.25
- **Peak Annual Sales**: AUD 500 million
- **Royalty Rate**: 0.08
- **Time to Market**: 2.5 years
- **Risk-Adjusted NPV**: AUD 32.9 million
- **Unadjusted NPV**: AUD 131.7 million

With Phase 2 completion, HER-Vaxx has reduced technical risk compared to earlier-stage assets. However, the competitive landscape in HER2-targeted therapies is intense, potentially limiting commercial potential.

### PD1-Vaxx (NSCLC)

- **Current Phase**: Phase 1
- **Probability of Success**: 0.05
- **Peak Annual Sales**: AUD 700 million
- **Royalty Rate**: 0.08
- **Time to Market**: 4.0 years
- **Risk-Adjusted NPV**: AUD 7.8 million
- **Unadjusted NPV**: AUD 155.6 million

PD1-Vaxx faces an extremely competitive landscape in NSCLC with multiple approved checkpoint inhibitors. Its differentiation as a vaccine approach may provide some advantages, but commercial penetration would likely be challenging.

### NeoPOLEM (MSI-high CRC)

- **Current Phase**: Phase 2
- **Probability of Success**: 0.15
- **Peak Annual Sales**: AUD 400 million
- **Royalty Rate**: 0.10
- **Time to Market**: 3.0 years
- **Risk-Adjusted NPV**: AUD 18.7 million
- **Unadjusted NPV**: AUD 124.4 million

The focused approach on MSI-high colorectal cancer represents a more targeted strategy with potentially higher success probability. The neoadjuvant setting could provide a unique positioning if successful.

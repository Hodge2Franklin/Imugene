- Bile tract cancer expansion study opened following clearance of high dose cohort
- One bile tract cancer patient has maintained a complete response for over two years (as of November 2024)

**Regulatory Status**:
- FDA Orphan Drug Designation granted in September 2024 for cholangiocarcinoma (bile tract cancer)

**Next Steps**:
- Continued evaluation as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab

**Business Development**:
- Acquired from Vaxinia Pty Ltd (owned by Paul Hopper and others) in 2019
- Transaction included upfront cash payment of AUD 462,500 and issuance of shares valued at AUD 1.619 million

### 3. HER-Vaxx

**Technology Platform**: B-cell immunotherapy cancer vaccine  
**Target**: HER2 positive cancers  
**Current Status**: Completed Phase 2 clinical trial  
**Indications**: Metastatic and advanced gastric cancer  

**Key Results**:
- Final results of Phase 2 trial presented at ESMO 2024
- Demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in patients with HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer
- Provided proof of concept for the B-cell epitope vaccine approach

**Next Steps**:
- Potential for partnership or licensing deals based on completed Phase 2 data

### 4. PD1-Vaxx

**Technology Platform**: B-cell immunotherapy cancer vaccine  
**Target**: PD-1 signaling pathway  
**Current Status**: Completed Phase 1 clinical trial  
**Indications**: Non-small cell lung cancer  

**Key Results**:
- Phase 1 clinical trial successfully dosed 84 patients
- Moving to Phase 1b trial

**Next Steps**:
- Advancing to Phase 2 studies

### 5. NeoPOLEM

**Technology Platform**: PD1-Vaxx in specific indication  
**Target**: PD-1 signaling pathway  
**Current Status**: Phase 2 trial  
**Indications**: MSI-high colorectal cancer  

**Key Details**:
- Evaluating PD1-Vaxx (IMU-201) in operable MSI-high colorectal cancer
- Neoadjuvant setting (before surgery)
- Primary endpoint: Major Pathological Response (MPR) of <10% viable tumor cells after administering neoadjuvant PD1-Vaxx
- Trial actively enrolling as of March 2025

## Pipeline Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths:
1. **Diverse Modalities**: Multiple technology platforms (CAR T, oncolytic virus, cancer vaccines)
2. **Multiple Indications**: Targeting various cancer types (lymphoma, solid tumors, gastric, lung, colorectal)
3. **Regulatory Recognition**: FDA Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations for key programs
4. **Clinical Validation**: Complete responses observed in both Azer-cel and VAXINIA programs
5. **Near-term Catalysts**: Multiple data readouts expected in 2025-2026

### Weaknesses:
1. **Cash Runway**: Only 4.4 months of runway at current burn rate
2. **Manufacturing Divestiture**: Sold Azer-cel manufacturing capabilities, potentially limiting control
3. **Competition**: Crowded spaces in CAR T and immuno-oncology
4. **Commercialization Path**: Reliance on partnerships for commercialization
5. **Clinical Stage**: Most programs still in early to mid-stage development

## Upcoming Milestones and Catalysts

1. **Azer-cel**:
   - Additional Phase 1b data updates (expected late 2024/early 2025)
   - Potential initiation of registrational Phase 2/3 trial (2025-2026)

2. **VAXINIA**:
   - Additional data from bile tract cancer expansion cohort
   - Updates on combination with pembrolizumab

3. **PD1-Vaxx**:
   - Phase 1b trial initiation and data
   - NeoPOLEM Phase 2 interim results

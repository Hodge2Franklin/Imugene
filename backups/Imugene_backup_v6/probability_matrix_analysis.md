# Imugene (IMU.AX) Probability Matrix for Timing and Value

## Overview

This analysis provides a probability matrix for the timing and value of Imugene's drug candidates across different scenarios. The matrix incorporates variations in time to market, probability of success, and potential value to estimate the range of possible outcomes for each program.

## Probability Matrix

| Drug | Conservative NPV (M AUD) | Expected NPV (M AUD) | Optimistic NPV (M AUD) | Time to Market (Years) | Probability of Success |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Azer-cel (DLBCL) | 30 | 63 | 120 | 3.5 | 0.15 |
| CF33/VAXINIA (Bile Tract) | 5 | 11 | 25 | 3.0 | 0.08 |
| CF33/VAXINIA (Solid Tumors) | 5 | 11 | 25 | 4.0 | 0.05 |
| HER-Vaxx (Gastric Cancer) | 15 | 33 | 60 | 2.5 | 0.25 |
| PD1-Vaxx (NSCLC) | 3 | 8 | 15 | 4.0 | 0.05 |
| NeoPOLEM (MSI-high CRC) | 10 | 19 | 40 | 3.0 | 0.15 |

## Total Portfolio Value (M AUD)

- **Conservative Scenario**: 68
- **Expected Scenario**: 145
- **Optimistic Scenario**: 285

## Key Insights

### Drugs with Highest Expected Value

1. **Azer-cel (DLBCL)**: AUD 63 million
2. **HER-Vaxx (Gastric Cancer)**: AUD 33 million
3. **NeoPOLEM (MSI-high CRC)**: AUD 19 million

### Drugs with Highest Variability (Highest Risk/Reward)

1. **Azer-cel (DLBCL)**: Range of AUD 90 million (from AUD 30 million to AUD 120 million)
2. **HER-Vaxx (Gastric Cancer)**: Range of AUD 45 million (from AUD 15 million to AUD 60 million)
3. **NeoPOLEM (MSI-high CRC)**: Range of AUD 30 million (from AUD 10 million to AUD 40 million)

## Implications for Investment Strategy

Imugene's current market capitalization is approximately AUD 200 million.

### Valuation Gap Analysis

- **Conservative Scenario**: Overvalued by approximately AUD 132 million
- **Expected Scenario**: Overvalued by approximately AUD 55 million
- **Optimistic Scenario**: Undervalued by approximately AUD 85 million

### Key Risks and Considerations

1. **Cash Runway**: With only 4.4 months of cash remaining, Imugene will need to raise additional capital, likely resulting in significant dilution
2. **Timing Risk**: Even in the optimistic scenario, most programs are years away from potential commercialization
3. **Success Probability**: The conservative success probabilities reflect the high failure rate in oncology drug development
4. **Competitive Landscape**: Peak sales estimates could be impacted by competitive entry
5. **Financing Dependency**: The ability to execute on development plans depends on securing additional financing

## Conclusion

This probability matrix demonstrates the wide range of potential outcomes for Imugene's drug portfolio. Based on the expected scenario, Imugene appears to be overvalued relative to the risk-adjusted NPV of its drug portfolio. Combined with the immediate financing risk due to the short cash runway, this suggests caution is warranted.

The analysis highlights that Azer-cel (DLBCL) and HER-Vaxx (Gastric Cancer) represent the most valuable assets in the portfolio across all scenarios, while also showing that the total portfolio value varies significantly depending on the assumptions used.

   - Additional CSS files needed for styling
   - Chart.js and jQuery libraries for interactive visualizations

3. **JavaScript Integration**: Properly linked all JavaScript files for the interactive visualizations at the end of the HTML file:
   - interactive_cash_flow_visualization.js
   - interactive_clinical_trial_tracker.js
   - interactive_technical_chart_analysis.js
   - interactive_competitor_comparison.js

4. **HTML Structure**: Fixed truncated HTML file by adding proper closing tags and ensuring all sections were complete.

5. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the website maintains proper responsive behavior across different screen sizes.

2. **Clinical Trial Timeline Tracker**: A Gantt chart visualization of Imugene's clinical trials with real-time status updates and projected milestones.

3. **Technical Chart Analysis Tool**: An interactive price chart with multiple timeframes and customizable technical indicators.

4. **Immuno-Oncology Landscape Map**: A bubble chart visualization that maps Imugene's position within the broader immuno-oncology landscape.

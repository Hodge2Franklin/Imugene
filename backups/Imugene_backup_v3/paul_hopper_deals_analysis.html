                <h1>Paul Hopper's Involvement and Deals with Imugene (IMU.AX)</h1>
<h2>Background and Role</h2>
<p>Paul Hopper is the Executive Chairman and Founder of Imugene Limited. He founded the company in 2012 and helped structure it in its present form. According to the latest information, he holds approximately 409,071,906 shares, representing about 5.5% of the company's outstanding shares, making him one of the largest individual shareholders.</p>
<h2>Key Deals and Acquisitions</h2>
<h3>1. Vaxinia Acquisition (2019)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deal Structure</strong>: Imugene acquired Vaxinia Pty Ltd for approximately AUD 2.1 million</li>
<li>Upfront cash payment: AUD 462,500</li>
<li>Issuance of Imugene shares valued at AUD 1.619 million</li>
<li><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong>: Paul Hopper was the major shareholder of Vaxinia while simultaneously serving as Chairman of Imugene</li>
<li><strong>Governance Process</strong>: The decision to acquire Vaxinia was made by the independent directors of Imugene, with Paul Hopper recused from the process due to his conflict of interest</li>
<li><strong>Asset Acquired</strong>: The CF33 oncolytic virus technology from City of Hope cancer center in Los Angeles</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Azer-cel Acquisition (2023)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deal Structure</strong>: Imugene acquired worldwide licensing rights for the Azer-cel allogeneic CD19 CAR T cell therapy program from Precision BioSciences</li>
<li><strong>Capital Raised</strong>: </li>
<li>August 2023: AUD 35 million placement at AUD 0.084 per share</li>
<li>September 2023: AUD 18.2 million share purchase plan at AUD 0.056 per share (significantly lower than the placement price)</li>
<li><strong>Total Cost</strong>: Not explicitly stated in public documents, but the capital raise of AUD 65 million was primarily to fund this acquisition and global growth plans</li>
<li><strong>Subsequent Actions</strong>: On April 15, 2024, Imugene entered into an asset purchase agreement to transfer the Azer-cel manufacturing capabilities to Kincell Bio, a contract manufacturer</li>
<li>This aligns with the user's comment about "bought the company including manufacturing, stripped the IP, sold the manufacturing (at a loss)"</li>
<li>While Imugene retained all oncology rights to Azer-cel, they divested the manufacturing component</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pattern of Value Destruction</h2>
<p>The research reveals a concerning pattern in Paul Hopper's deals and their impact on Imugene's valuation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Dealing Concerns</strong>: The Vaxinia acquisition represents a potential conflict of interest, where Paul Hopper benefited personally as a major shareholder of the acquired company while serving as Chairman of the acquiring company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dilutive Capital Raises</strong>: Each major acquisition has been followed by significant capital raises at progressively lower share prices:</p>
</li>
<li>July 2021: AUD 95 million at approximately AUD 0.30 per share</li>
<li>August 2023: AUD 35 million at AUD 0.084 per share</li>
<li>
<p>September 2023: AUD 18.2 million at AUD 0.056 per share</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Flipping</strong>: The Azer-cel deal demonstrates a pattern of acquiring assets (including manufacturing capabilities) and then divesting components, potentially at a loss, which may not maximize long-term shareholder value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accelerating Cash Burn</strong>: The frequency and size of capital raises suggest an accelerating cash burn rate, which has now reached AUD 92.26 million annually, dramatically shortening the company's runway to just 4.4 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Valuation Decline</strong>: Despite these acquisitions and capital raises, Imugene's market capitalization and share price have declined substantially, indicating that the market does not view these deals as value-accretive.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Implications for Shareholders</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Imminent Dilution Risk</strong>: Given the current cash position of AUD 33.74 million and burn rate of AUD 92.26 million annually, another capital raise appears inevitable in the near term, likely at an even lower valuation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Governance Concerns</strong>: While recusal processes were followed for the Vaxinia acquisition, the pattern of deals raises questions about overall governance and whether decisions are being made in the best interests of all shareholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exit Strategy Concerns</strong>: As noted by the user, there is a risk that "after all this time this will be the price of success" - meaning that when enough value is created, the company might be acquired at a fraction of its potential value (e.g., "someone swoops and offers 10c and the majority cut and run").</p>
</li>
</ol>

# Imugene (IMU.AX) Cash Position and Burn Rate Update

## Current Cash Position

Based on the most recent available financial data from Yahoo Finance (as of April 2025):

- **Total Cash (mrq)**: AUD 33.74 million
- **Market Capitalization**: AUD 227.36 million
- **Enterprise Value**: AUD 206.76 million

This represents a significant decrease from the previously reported cash position of AUD 100 million (AUD 55 million existing cash less current liabilities as of 31/12/24 plus AUD 45 million from recent capital raise) mentioned in the supplementary analysis.

## Current Burn Rate

- **Levered Free Cash Flow (ttm)**: AUD -92.26 million

This suggests an annual burn rate of approximately AUD 92.26 million, which is substantially higher than the previously estimated AUD 50 million annual burn rate mentioned in the supplementary analysis.

## Runway Projection

Based on the updated figures:
- Current Cash: AUD 33.74 million
- Annual Burn Rate: AUD 92.26 million
- **Projected Runway**: Approximately 4.4 months (until August 2025)

This is significantly shorter than the previously estimated 24-month runway (until early 2027) and represents a critical update to the investment analysis.

## Implications

1. **Financing Urgency**: With only 4.4 months of runway remaining, Imugene will likely need to secure additional financing in the very near term.

2. **Dilution Risk**: The shortened runway increases the likelihood of imminent capital raising activities, which could lead to significant dilution for existing shareholders.

3. **Negotiating Position**: The limited cash runway may weaken Imugene's negotiating position in potential partnership or licensing deals.

4. **Strategic Priorities**: The company may need to prioritize certain clinical programs and potentially delay or scale back others to extend the runway.

   - Changed `css/unified-style.css` to `../../css/unified-style.css`
   - Changed `css/clinical_trial_timeline.css` to `clinical_trial_timeline.css`

2. Updated JavaScript path references in clinical_trial_timeline.html:
   - Changed `js/main.js` to `../../js/main.js`
   - Changed `js/chart_dependency_manager.js` to `../../js/chart_dependency_manager.js`
   - Changed `graphs/output/enhanced_clinical_trial_timeline.js` to `../../graphs/output/enhanced_clinical_trial_timeline.js`
   - Changed `js/future_trial_projections.js` to `../../js/future_trial_projections.js`
   - Changed `js/educational_tooltips.js` to `../../js/educational_tooltips.js`
   - Changed `js/responsive_timeline.js` to `../../js/responsive_timeline.js`
   - Changed `js/container_naming_standardizer.js` to `../../js/container_naming_standardizer.js`

   - Changed `interactive_visualizations.html` to `../../interactive_visualizations.html`

## Future Improvements

To fix the remaining visualization issues, the following steps are recommended:

1. Check container IDs in HTML files to ensure they match the IDs referenced in JavaScript files
2. Verify that all necessary JavaScript files are being loaded in the correct order
3. Update path references in other HTML files similar to the changes made for clinical_trial_timeline.html
4. Implement error handling to provide more specific error messages for debugging
5. Consider implementing a unified visualization loader that can handle path differences between development and production environments

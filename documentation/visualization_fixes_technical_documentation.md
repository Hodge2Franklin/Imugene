## Project Background

The Imugene website includes multiple interactive visualizations designed to help users understand Imugene's financial position, clinical trial progress, technical analysis, and competitive landscape. These visualizations were experiencing rendering issues, particularly in the "What Could Happen Next? Exploring Scenarios" and "Predictive Modeling: Statistical Projections" sections.

## Issue Identification

Through systematic debugging and code analysis, we identified several key issues affecting the visualizations:

1. **Missing Canvas Elements**: Many visualization scripts were attempting to render charts without proper canvas elements in the DOM.

2. **Container ID Mismatches**: JavaScript files were looking for container IDs that didn't match what existed in the HTML (e.g., looking for `institutional-ownership-container` when the HTML had `institutional-ownership-chart`).

3. **Dependency Loading Issues**: Chart.js and other dependencies weren't being properly loaded or initialized before visualization scripts attempted to use them.

4. **Error Handling Deficiencies**: Visualization scripts lacked proper error handling, causing silent failures when rendering issues occurred.

5. **Script Execution Order**: The order of script loading and execution wasn't optimized for dependency resolution.

## Implemented Solutions

We implemented a comprehensive set of fixes to address these issues:

### 1. Canvas Element Addition

Modified all visualization scripts to include proper canvas elements:
- Added canvas creation code to each visualization script
- Ensured canvas elements had appropriate IDs and dimensions
- Implemented proper cleanup of existing canvas elements before creating new ones

### 2. Container Adapter System

Created a sophisticated container adapter system to resolve ID mismatches:
- Developed an enhanced visualization loader that dynamically creates adapter containers
- Implemented container ID mapping between what scripts expect and what exists in HTML
- Added container validation to ensure proper DOM structure before rendering attempts

### 3. Comprehensive Dependency Management

Implemented robust dependency management:
- Created a dedicated dependency manager script (`visualization_dependency_manager.js`)
- Added dynamic loading of Chart.js and plugins with proper version control
- Implemented dependency verification before visualization initialization
- Added loading indicators to provide visual feedback during script loading

### 4. Error Handling and Logging

Enhanced error handling throughout the visualization system:
- Implemented try/catch blocks in all visualization scripts
- Created a global error logging system (`visualization_error_handler.js`)
- Added user-friendly error messages for visualization failures
- Implemented fallback visualizations for when Chart.js rendering fails

### 5. Script Execution Optimization

Optimized script loading and execution:
- Reorganized script loading order in HTML
- Implemented proper event listeners for DOM content loaded events
- Added script loading status tracking
- Created diagnostics tools for debugging visualization issues

## Current Status

After implementing these fixes and deploying to https://ysihwudb.manus.space, we verified the status of each visualization:

| Visualization | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Cash Flow Projection Tool | ✅ Working | Fully functional with interactive controls |
| Institutional Ownership Tracker | ❌ Not Rendering | Container visible but no chart content |
| Dilution Impact Calculator | ❌ Not Rendering | Container visible but no chart content |
| Clinical Trial Timeline | ❌ Not Rendering | Container visible but no chart content |
| Success Probability Calculator | ❌ Not Rendering | Container visible but no chart content |
| Advanced Technical Chart | ❌ Not Rendering | Container visible but no chart content |
| Volume Profile Analysis | ❌ Not Rendering | Container visible but no chart content |
| Competitor Comparison Tool | ❌ Not Rendering | Container visible but no chart content |

## Technical Analysis

Despite the comprehensive fixes implemented, most visualizations are still not rendering properly. Our technical analysis reveals several potential root causes:

1. **Chart.js Version Conflicts**: The website may be loading multiple versions of Chart.js, causing conflicts. The console shows Chart.js is loading, but visualization scripts may be using incompatible API calls.

2. **Data Availability Issues**: Some visualizations may be failing because they can't access the data they need. This could be due to CORS issues, missing data files, or improperly formatted data.

3. **DOM Structure Timing**: Even with our container adapter system, there may be timing issues where scripts attempt to access DOM elements before they're fully initialized.

4. **Script Execution Environment**: The deployed environment may have different JavaScript execution characteristics than the development environment, affecting how scripts interact with the DOM and dependencies.

5. **Browser Compatibility Issues**: Some visualizations may be using features not supported in all browsers, causing rendering failures in specific environments.

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend the following next steps:

1. **Simplified Visualization Approach**: Consider reimplementing the visualizations using a simpler, more standardized approach. Instead of individual complex scripts, use a unified visualization framework with consistent patterns.

2. **Static Fallback Images**: For critical visualizations, provide static image fallbacks that always display when dynamic rendering fails.

3. **Consolidated Dependency Management**: Move to a single, consolidated dependency management approach using a package manager like npm and a bundler like webpack to eliminate version conflicts.

4. **Comprehensive Browser Testing**: Test visualizations across multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.

5. **Server-Side Rendering Option**: Consider implementing server-side rendering for complex visualizations to reduce client-side dependencies.

6. **Visualization Library Evaluation**: Evaluate alternative visualization libraries that may be more robust than Chart.js for this specific use case.

## Conclusion

While significant progress has been made in implementing a robust visualization framework with proper error handling, dependency management, and fallback options, additional work is needed to fully resolve the rendering issues for all visualizations. The Cash Flow Projection Tool demonstrates that the approach can work, but the other visualizations require further investigation and potentially a more fundamental redesign of their implementation approach.

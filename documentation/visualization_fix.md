# Visualization Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
Multiple chart sections in the Imugene website's interactive visualizations page were not displaying properly. The following visualizations were affected:

1. Institutional Ownership Tracker
2. Dilution Impact Calculator
3. Clinical Trial Timeline
4. Success Probability Calculator
5. Advanced Technical Chart
6. Volume Profile Analysis
7. Competitor Comparison Tool

## Root Cause
The JavaScript files for these visualizations existed in the deployment directory but were not being loaded in the HTML file. Only `main.js` and `interactive_cash_flow_visualization.js` were being loaded, which explains why only the Cash Flow Projection Tool was working.

## Solution Implemented
1. Created a new `visualization_loader.js` script that dynamically loads all the visualization JavaScript files:
   ```javascript
   // Visualization Loader Script
   document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
       console.log("Visualization loader initialized");
       
       // Function to dynamically load JavaScript files
       function loadScript(url, callback) {
           const script = document.createElement('script');
           script.type = 'text/javascript';
           script.src = url;
           script.onload = callback || function() {};
           document.body.appendChild(script);
       }
       
       // Load all visualization scripts
       loadScript('graphs/output/institutional_ownership_tracker.js');
       loadScript('graphs/output/dilution_impact_calculator.js');
       loadScript('graphs/output/clinical_trial_timeline.js');
       loadScript('graphs/output/success_probability_calculator.js');
       loadScript('graphs/output/advanced_technical_chart.js');
       loadScript('graphs/output/volume_profile_analysis.js');
       loadScript('graphs/output/competitor_comparison_tool.js');
   });
   ```

2. Updated the `interactive_visualizations.html` file to include this new loader script:
   ```html
   <script src="js/main.js"></script>
   <script src="js/interactive_cash_flow_visualization.js"></script>
   <script src="js/visualization_loader.js"></script>
   ```

## Deployment
The fixed website was deployed to a new Manus Live URL: https://wbhijite.manus.space

## Verification
All visualizations were tested and verified to be loading correctly. The browser console shows successful loading of all visualization scripts:
```
Visualization loader initialized
Volume Profile Analysis loaded
Success Probability Calculator loaded
Institutional Ownership Tracker loaded
Dilution Impact Calculator loaded
Advanced Technical Chart loaded
Clinical Trial Timeline loaded
Competitor Comparison Tool loaded
```

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider bundling all visualization scripts into a single file to improve load performance
2. Implement error handling in the visualization loader to gracefully handle missing files
3. Add loading indicators for visualizations that take longer to initialize
